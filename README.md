I'm passionate about cybersecurity and love tackling complex challenges through hands-on, practical projects. From vulnerability management and threat detection to ethical hacking and penetration testing, my work spans both the defensive and offensive sides of security.

These projects let me dive deep into the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity; I build, break, and secure systems to better understand how to protect them.
