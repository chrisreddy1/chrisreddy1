I'm a cybersecurity professional who thrives on hands-on learning — from simulating real-world attacks in lab environments to building proactive defense strategies. Whether it's hunting for threats in a SOC, building secure architectures, or rooting vulnerable boxes, I enjoy diving deep into both the red and blue sides of security.
